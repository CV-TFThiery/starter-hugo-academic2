abstract: >-
  Given a variable of interest, we would like to find the best linear predictor
  for it by choosing a subset of $k$ relevant variables obeying a matroid
  constraint. This problem is a natural generalization of subset selection
  problems where it is necessary to spread observations amongst multiple
  different classes. We derive new and strengthened guarantees for this problem
  by improving the analysis of the $\textsc{Residual Random Greedy}$ and by
  developing a novel distorted local search. Our algorithms have optimal
  asymptotic guarantees.

  The central piece of our work is the introduction of a novel data-dependent parameter extendingÂ Das and Kempe's definition [paper$\url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.3975}$]. In the regression problem, this parameter is connected to the minimum $k$-sparse eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. We obtain similar results that Bayesian A-optimal Design and Column Subset Selection leading to new guarantees for these problems as well.
